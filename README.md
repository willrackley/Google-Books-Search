# Google-Books-Search

![Home Page](/client/src/images/googleBS.png)

This is a React-based Google Books Search app. It works with helper/util functions, and utilizes React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. It also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so users can save books to review or purchase later. 

## How it works

Once the user has landed on the landing page, they can either choose to search for a book by clicking on `find book` or view the list of books saved by users by clicking `view saved books`/ `saved books`.

* Searching for a book is as simple as just entering in any type of information about the book you are looking for into the input field (author, title, etc).

* You can save a book by clicking the `SAVE` button. A popup will notify you that the book has been saved. Click anywhere outside of the popup to get rid of the notification.

* In the saved books page the user is presented with a list of items that have been saved (if any). Click the `DELETE` button to remove the book from the saved list.
